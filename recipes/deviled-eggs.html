        <p>These deviled eggs are delicious for Easter brunch and are 
        always popular at our holiday parties. Adjust the amount of 
        salt and sugar in this recipe to suit your taste. 
        I like to add onion and celery for a little more texture.</p>

    <h2>ingrediants</h2>
        <p>these are the simple kitchen staples you'll need to make
        this basic deviled egg recipe:</p>
    <ul>

         egg halves, so you'll need six boiled eggs.</li>

        <li><b>Sugar:</b> A teaspoon of white sugar lends a hint of sweetness. </li>
